# EEG-Cleaner
Perform cleaning and preprocessing on raw EEG data, including functions such as bad segment detection, bad segment rejection, removal of EOG and EMG, and bad channel repair.

## Overview

This tool is designed for cleaning and preprocessing raw EEG (electroencephalogram) data. It incorporates several functions to enhance the quality and usability of EEG recordings, making it suitable for further analysis or research.

## Features

- **Bad Segment Detection:** Automatically identifies portions of the data that are corrupted or of poor quality.
- **Bad Segment Rejection:** Rejects or removes the detected bad segments from the data set.
- **EOG and EMG Artifact Removal:** Identifies and eliminates artifacts caused by eye movements (ocular artifacts) and muscle movements (muscular artifacts).
- **Bad Channel Repair:** Repairs or interpolates data from EEG channels that are not functioning correctly.
